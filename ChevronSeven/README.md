# Chevron Seven

A stargate mod for **Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge)**, written from scratch: its own gate, Dial Home Device and iris, with all textures and symbols drawn by its own script. It needs no other stargate mod. With [CC: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked) installed, the gate is a computer peripheral that the [Gate Room, Network Hub](../StargateCommand/) and [Personal Dialer](../PersonalDialer/) drive just as they drive Stargate Journey.

## The gate

- A ring seven blocks across, with a symbol track that turns to each symbol, nine chevrons, and an event horizon that ripples and swirls.
- Dialing locks seven chevrons: six symbols, then the point of origin. The ring turns one way, then the other, and the top chevron engages each symbol.
- The wormhole opens with a kawoosh. The vortex vaporises anything standing in front of the gate (you can turn this off).
- Step into the event horizon of the gate you dialed from and you come out of the other gate, facing out, at the same height and side, even in another dimension. Travel is one way, from the dialing gate. The receiving gate's horizon doesn't send you back.
- The wormhole closes by itself after five minutes (configurable, up to 38 minutes). Only the dialing gate can close it, unless you allow it in the config.
- Both gates keep their chunks loaded while they are connected.
- The ring lights up its surroundings while a wormhole is open.
- A comparator next to the stargate block reads how many chevrons are locked.

Right-click any part of the ring to see the gate's address. Every gate gets its own random address of six different symbols from 1 to 38; the point of origin, symbol 0, is the same for every gate and is dialed last.

## Blocks and items

| | What it does | Recipe |
|---|---|---|
| **Stargate** | Place it on the ground, facing you: it needs a clear 7 × 7 space. You place the bottom middle block; the rest of the ring builds itself. Break any part to pick the whole gate up again. | iron blocks in the corners, eyes of ender on the sides, a lodestone in the middle |
| **Dial Home Device** | Right-click it to dial the nearest gate within 16 blocks. Press six symbols, then the big red button (or the point of origin). Press the red button again to close the wormhole; while dialing, it cancels the dial. | redstone block on top, gold ingot, compass, gold ingot in the middle, smooth sandstone along the bottom |
| **Gate Iris** | Use it on a gate to fit an iris. Close it from the DHD, a computer or a command. Travelers from the other side hit a closed iris and bounce back, and it stops the kawoosh. | iron ingots around an iron trapdoor |

## Computers (CC: Tweaked)

Put a computer against any block of the ring, or connect one with a wired modem. The peripheral type is `chevron7_stargate`.

| Method | |
|---|---|
| `getLocalAddress()` | this gate's address, e.g. `{12, 5, 30, 21, 7, 1}` |
| `engageSymbol(symbol)` | turns the ring to the symbol and locks a chevron; dial 0 last to open the wormhole |
| `dialAddress(address)` | dials a whole address, e.g. `dialAddress({12, 5, 30, 21, 7, 1})` |
| `disconnectStargate()` | closes the wormhole, or stops a dial |
| `getChevronsEngaged()`, `getDialedAddress()`, `getConnectedAddress()` | chevrons locked, symbols dialed, the address on the other side |
| `isStargateConnected()`, `isStargateDialingOut()`, `isWormholeOpen()`, `getOpenTime()` | the connection |
| `getGateState()` | `idle`, `dialing`, `opening`, `open`, `closing` or `resetting` |
| `getRotationDegrees()`, `getCurrentSymbol()`, `isCurrentSymbol(symbol)` | the symbol ring |
| `getIris()`, `openIris()`, `closeIris()`, `getIrisProgressPercentage()` | the iris |
| `getRecentFeedback()` | the last result as a code and a name, e.g. `-5, "invalid_address"` |
| `sendStargateMessage(text)` | the other gate gets a `stargate_message_received` event |
| `getStargateType()` | `"chevron7:stargate"` |

Events (the first argument is the peripheral's name): `stargate_chevron_engaged` (chevrons, chevron, incoming, symbol), `stargate_rotation_started`, `stargate_rotation_stopped`, `stargate_outgoing_wormhole` (address), `stargate_incoming_wormhole` (address), `stargate_disconnected` (code, reason), `stargate_reset` (code, reason), `stargate_deconstructing_entity` and `stargate_reconstructing_entity` (type, name, uuid), `iris_thud` (type, name, uuid) and `stargate_message_received` (text).

The names, the feedback codes and the events follow Stargate Journey's crystal interface, so programs written for that mostly work here as they are.

## Commands

For operators:

```
/chevron7 list                          every gate and its address
/chevron7 address <pos>                 the address and state of a gate
/chevron7 dial <pos> <address>          dial, e.g. /chevron7 dial ~ ~ ~5 12-5-30-21-7-1
/chevron7 close <pos>
/chevron7 iris <pos> open|close
```

`<pos>` can be any block of the ring.

## Config

`config/chevron7-common.toml`:

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `max_open_seconds` | 300 | how long a wormhole stays open (10 to 2280) |
| `kawoosh_kills` | true | the kawoosh destroys what stands in front of the gate |
| `incoming_can_close` | false | the receiving gate can close the wormhole too |

## Install

Put [`dist/chevron7-1.0.0.jar`](dist/chevron7-1.0.0.jar) in the `mods` folder (client and server) of a Forge 47 / Minecraft 1.20.1 game. CC: Tweaked is optional.

## Tested

- **Dedicated Forge 1.20.1 server (47.4.29) with CC: Tweaked 1.120.2**: three gates, one of them in the Nether.
  - The `sgc.gate` adapter of the Stargate Command programs found the gate, dialed it and closed it, and read its errors. Its events arrived in order.
  - The kawoosh killed a pig standing in front of the receiving gate.
  - A pig walked through to the other gate, and another came out at the gate in the Nether.
  - A closed iris bounced a traveler back.
  - Breaking the stargate block, or any block of the ring, removed the whole gate.
- **Minecraft 1.20.1 client** with software rendering (no graphics card): the screenshots on this page come from it. The gate was dialed with `/chevron7 dial`, and then by clicking six symbol keys and the big button on the DHD screen, which opened the wormhole to the other gate.

Not tested: playing with several people, and the sounds (all of them are Minecraft's own sounds; the test machine had no sound device).

## Build

```
python3 tools/make_resources.py   # only after changing it: textures, symbols, models, recipes
./gradlew build
```

The jar is `build/libs/chevron7-1.0.0.jar`.

## License

The repository has no license file yet, so this mod has no license either until the repository's owner picks one. Every texture and symbol is original, drawn by `tools/make_resources.py`.
